# Insight ~ Employee Management System
Insight is a app that was created to solve the problem of employees not getting the much needed guidence and feeback they deserve and supervisors inability to write SMART goals for their team to follow. This app provides the much needed feedback loop to get everyone on the same page, moving the organization forward. 

# Motivation
The idea for this app stemed from a brainstroming session between the team members, [Angela Andrews](https://github.com/angela-andrews), [Megan Anthony](https://github.com/angela-andrews), [Guillermo Barila](https://github.com/gui365) and [Dan Gross](https://github.com/DanielWGross).
